                <p>In 1998 The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill made history - a debut record that claimed space in hip-hop culture for black feminism and remains significant today. Lauryn Hill's lyrical themes broke the silence of black feminist issues in hip-hop and claimed unprecedented power and space.<br><br>

                Hill didn't open doors for just women in the industry, but for the entire hip-hop genre. She was nominated for 10 Grammys and won five in 1999, a record for a female artist at that time. Her five wins created a more widespread audience and crossover appeal for hip-hop.<br><br>

                Not only did Hill burst through the industry's glass ceiling, but many may not know that she created this masterpiece while pregnant. The emcee, songstress rejected society's notion that they must choose between family and a career. The fourth track, "To Zion," was for her son whom she carried while creating the album. "'Look at your career,' they said/'Lauryn baby use your head'/ But instead I chose to use my heart," she sings, referencing those who told her to consider an abortion so she wouldn't ruin her career.<br><br>

                Hill was "woke" before many artists like Talib Kwele, Kanye West and Kendrick Lamar came onto the music scene. She put her personal testimonies in her lyrics. Hill helped to create an avenue for honest and socially-conscious dialogue in music, from speaking about sexual objectivity in "Doo Wop (That Thing)" to failed relationships in "Ex-Factor" and other topics considered too taboo at the time. In 1999 she predicted that the music industry was about to shift without knowing that she would pave the way for many of today's artists. "I think now people feel a little more comfortable playing with the parameters. Writing more intensely," she told Rolling Stone.</p>
